Files shapes.cpp consist of a do while loop. The 2D shape and output information about their calculations for this shape are stored in an array. Whenever the user entered the 2D shape(every shape name should start with the capital letter) which is stored in the array, it shows to the user displaying the information about the calculation for this shape. If the user entered the shaped which is not stored in an array, it shows an information telling that the shape is not available. When user entered exit( make sure 'e' is not capitalized), it shows total number of shapes entered and exits the program.

Compilation instructions:

running shapes.cpp
g++ shapes.cpp( make sure 's' is not capitalized)
./a.out
