Files weight .cpp consist of a do while loop. 
When the program compile, it ask for the name and weight of a person. Make sure you write the weight of a person in eitehr kilos or pounds( 'k' and 'p' should not be capitalized). When user enter only name and weight of a person without units, it display an information telling that 'not enough info to convert'). When user inputs weight in kilos then program converts kilos to pounds and vice versa.  When user entered exit( make sure 'e' is not capitalized), it shows total number of shapes entered and exits the program.
